A Programmer's Tour of Hello World
=======================================

Hello World is traditionally the first program a developer writes when learning a new language. In most cases it represents the simplest program on can write, displaying the simple Phrase "Hello World".

In reality this means a number of things, you have successfully installed the required tools, to your machine and written syntatically correct code. And since the program didn't crash, you are now ready to write more complicated programs.

In this text our job will be to go through the languages and frameworks that make up the programming world, and say Hello to Each.

Our goal will be for each language and framework to offer a "Productionalized" version of helloworld. Creating a pieced of code that you can hand off to someone else and have them say Hello World back to you.
